# Lab 01 Reflection

During this lab, I learned the basic workflow of using Git for version control.  
I practiced creating and modifying files, adding comments, and tracking changes through commits.  
I also worked with branching by creating a new branch, making changes, and then merging those changes back into the main branch.  
This experience helped me understand how Git makes collaboration and project management more organized.  
Overall, it gave me a good foundation for using Git and GitHub in future web development projects.
